# Purpose

This script will help you speed up the checks you need to do on Solana tokens before opening orders.

Simply copy the token to your clipboard and this script will open the corresponding websites for the various checks.

For example, if you follow a Telegram channel and click on a referral token, as soon as it is copied to your clipboard, the script will do the rest. This will save you several precious seconds!

# Requirements
